# Hackcation Project

We created a project to help people going on vacation settle their conflicting interests and form a personalized travel itinerary to ensure that everybody has a good time!



We do this through an input submission on our custom made web applicaiton that gages the interests of each individual member of the group, then based of their submissions, we create a custom score that relates to the individuals interests, and based on the overall group score, shows a custom made trip for the group.


# Essential Features
- Lobby System + Code/Custom Link (form groups)
- Take in user input on location of vacation 
- Sends out a link to a survey that people taking the vacation need to fill out 
    - what kinds of questions should the survey have?
    - favourite food?
    - activities? (hiking, surfing, etc.)
- Takes the survey results and creates an itenerary for the trip
- Implement Google Maps API to show the locations of all the given areas and the ways to get to the places
